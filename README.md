### Important of my projects : 
=> Website development is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining a website. Essentially, the difference between web development and website design is that the designer in website design designs the user interface of the website. On the other side, web designers work with web developers to incorporate web design into the web development process.

=> Here i can use different library components of react-router dom and i uses loader for load dynamic data. Also uses useContext in main layout so that minimize loader component.

## Working Procedre:
1. npm i react-router-dom
2. create a router-using createBrowserRouter
3. Add RouterProvider and set router prop
4. Create a lot of components
5. Create main layout with some common part and changing part based on the router
6. set main layout at the root of the route
7. set children routes
8. set links on the header components
